Welcome to the first problem set - an introduction to posit.cloud, the RStudio interface, and the quarto document format. This document is a quarto `.qmd` created by Prof. Brotherton. It is full of instructions (like this!) and questions for you to complete.\n\nThis project is set up as an \"Assignment\" which means that when you clicked into it, the system created your own copy for you to work on. Prof. B and your TA will also be able to see and access it to provide help. You will edit each `problem-set-#.qmd` document to add your solutions.\n\nAs you're working on a problem set, you'll click \"Render\" to see how the final document looks with your own text, code, and output all woven together as a nicely-formatted pdf.\n\nTry rendering this document now. First, click on the settings cogwheel next to \"Render\" in the menu near the top of the editor and select \"Preview in Viewer Pane\". Then click the \"Render\" button itself. You should then see the page open in the \"viewer\" pane on the right. Initially it'll just have the questions I've pre-written (my instructions are hidden). As you add answers and code you can click \"Render\" again to see your work coming together.\n\nRead all the instructions carefully and answer the questions to the best of your ability.\n\n:::: {.content-visible when-format=\"html\"}\n::: {.callout-tip collapse=\"false\"}\n## Bonus: Personalize your PDF\n\nLook for the file named `_quarto.yml` under the Files tab. It contains some instructions that the rendering system uses to make your finished PDF document. The last line is `author: \"\"`. Put your name inside the quotation marks, and every time you render a PDF it will have your name at the top.\n:::\n::::\n\n# Part 1: Typing short text answers\n\n# Part 2: Doing sums and coding in R\n\n::: {.content-visible when-format=\"html\"}\n## Instructions\n\nThis is where we can start using R code to find answers to questions. Using the quarto document format, you include code \"chunks\" where you will write your code. The code will get executed when you Render the document (or you can execute it interactively to see output right away).\n\nThe easiest way to insert a code chunk is to put your cursor on a new line and type a forward-slash on your keyboard (`/`).\n\nYou should see a pop up showing all the stuff you can put into a document. The first option is an \"R code chunk\" which is what you need, so you can click it or just press return on the keyboard to insert the chunk. If you prefer, you can also click Insert \\> Executable Cell \\> R from the menu at the top of the editor.\n\nHere's what a code chunk looks like:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Code goes here! This is just a comment. Comments are preceded by the # symbol\n```\n:::\n\n\n``` markdown\n{r}\n# Code goes here! This is just a comment. Comments are preceded by the # symbol\n```\n\nYou should thoroughly comment and/or annotate your problem sets with regular text like this, to explain to any reader (including your future self) what your code is doing. (You will forget!)\n\nFor the following questions, you could easily do these sums by hand - and I recommend checking your answers that way. But it is important to learn how to do these kinds of things in R as well. Usually there's more than one way to achieve something in R.\n\nIf you want to add up a set of scores, you can use R just like a calculator:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n1 + 2 + 3 + 4\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] 10\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\nWhen you \"Render\", the code will be executed and you'll see the answer right after the code. You can also run the code yourself to see the answer right now. Put your cursor on the line of code and press Ctrl/Command + Enter on your keyboard. You'll see the answer in the \"Console\" pane below. Note that you DON'T type `1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 10`. In fact, that'll confuse R and you'll get an error. (Try it)\n\nRather than just typing the sum out like that, a better way is to assign the scores a name. The `<-` arrow operator is used to assign names. The name can be anything you want except that it cannot include spaces and cannot start with a number.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nscores <- c(1, 2, 3, 4)\n```\n:::\n\n\nThe `c()` function collects items. If you run the previous line of code with Ctrl/Cmd + Enter, you'll see something called \"scores\" appear over in the Global Environment pane on the top-right. It consists of the numbers 1, 2, 3, and 4 collected together as a set. You won't actually see any output though, and nothing will show up in your Rendered document. If you want a named object to be shown, you can type the name as a line of code.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nscores\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] 1 2 3 4\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\nTo add the set of scores up, we can use the `sum()` function.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nsum(scores)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] 10\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThis might not seem like a time-saver with just 4 numbers, but imagine if you had a dataset of 1000 numbers...\n\nYou can do other things, like squaring each score, or squaring the summed scores. Note that R follows the usual order of mathematical operations.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nsum(scores^2) \n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] 30\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nsum(scores)^2 \n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] 100\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\nNow you should be ready to answer the questions below by typing your own code.\n:::\n\n:::: {.content-visible when-format=\"html\"}\n::: {.callout-tip collapse=\"false\"}\n## Formatting equations in-text\n\nNotice how mathematical symbols are created in the question text below: Click on the symbols and you'll see that, behind the scenes, equations are enclosed in dollar signs. Typing a backslash and \"Sigma\" produces the symbol for summation.\n\nThere may be times that you'll want to type symbols or equations like these in your answers to questions, so it's worth knowing how to do so.\n:::\n::::\n\n# Part 3: Working with data\n\n::: {.content-visible when-format=\"html\"}\n# Instructions\n\nThe last thing I want to introduce here is the idea of working with external data files. If a researcher were working with actual data, it would most often be in the form of a separate file, such as a .csv (for comma separated values). You can open a .csv in Excel and you should see a spreadsheet with columns and rows.\n\nTo read a .csv file into R, we use the `read.csv()`function, specifying the path to the file within the parentheses. There's a file in the \"data\" folder of this project named \"1_example.csv\". We can read it into R like this:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nread.csv(\"data/1_example.csv\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n  x\n1 1\n2 2\n3 3\n4 4\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\nYou should see a column of numbers in the console and/or on your knitted pdf. Notice, however, that although we can see the scores, they aren't \"saved\" for us to work with in R. To do that, we need to assign the file a name, like so:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ndata <- read.csv(\"data/1_example.csv\")\n```\n:::\n\n\nIf you run that line of code, you should see a new object in your Global Environment.\n\nThe data is in a form that R calls a \"data.frame\". That is an object consisting of rows and columns, just like an excel spreadsheet. In fact, you can open it and see it just like a spreadsheet by clicking on the name in the Global Environment Pane. That will open a new tab where you can see the data. (Be sure to make a mental note of the names of the column(s) since you'll likely be needing to refer to them soon!)\n\nUnlike in Excel, we don't interact with the data directly within the spreadsheet. Instead, we write and execute code separately from the data.\n\nThe last thing you need to know for now is the `$` operator. This is one way that we can refer to a particular column of a data.frame. We named the data.frame itself \"data\", and the only column within that data.frame is named \"x\", as you can see by clicking on it in the Global Environment, or running the function `names(data)`. So to point R to that column, we write `data$x`, like so:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ndata$x\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] 1 2 3 4\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\nNow you're ready to manipulate data pulled from an external .csv, e.g.:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nsum(data$x)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] 10\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThis is equivalent to writing the formula =SUM(A1:A4) in an Excel spreadsheet to add up a column of scores. The advantage of writing code separately is that we aren't altering the data file itself at all. This facilitates data sharing and writing reproducible analyses (anyone can re-run your exact code) while maintaining the integrity of the raw data.\n:::\n\n# Part 4. Submitting via Canvas (and some final tips)\n\n::: {.content-visible when-format=\"html\"}\n## How to submit your assignment\n\nWhen you're completely finished, and after clicking \"Render\" for the final time, you'll download a pdf version of your finished problem set and submit that via Canvas. You'll do this for each problem set.\n\nLook for the \"Other Formats\" \\> \"PDF\" link on the rendered page. Clicking that should open the .pdf version of your problem set. Save it to your hard drive by clicking the download icon, go to the Assignment in Canvas, and upload your completed .pdf there.\n\nMake sure to carefully look over your pdf when you think you're done. You want to make sure everything looks the way you expect it to (including showing all your code and comments). That's what I or your TA will see and provide feedback on, so make sure it is what you intend for us to see.\n:::\n\n:::: {.content-visible when-format=\"html\"}\n::: {.callout-tip collapse=\"false\"}\n## Congrats!\n\nThat's it! Congrats on completing your first problem set.\n\nThey get more difficult as the course goes on, and I gradually reduce the amount of guidance I give as you get to grips with the basics. R can be tricky - error messages are common, and not always helpful. The first thing to check is usually for any typing errors. R is always case-sensitive and you must type any names (e.g. of files, folders, column or variable names) exactly right. It is also important to know that when you Render, R ignores everything in your Global Environment pane and tries running all the code in your document from scratch. If it can't find the right named object in the code it will throw up an error (even if you can see the object in your Global Environment). So make sure it is in your code. Also bear in mind that if you reuse names (e.g. calling two different sets of scores \"scores\" at different points), R will simply overwrite the object without warning you. This isn't a problem if you're aware of it and expecting it, but it can cause confusion if it wasn't what you meant to do.\n\nIf you're ever getting an error message and don't know what it means or what to do, copy and paste it into Google. Usually that'll bring you to stackoverflow.com, where someone else had a similar issue and someone else knew the answer. I also encourage you to collaborate with others in the class (sharing ideas/thoughts/struggles is great, just don't copy and paste one another's code). And of course you can always get help from me and/or your TA. We can access your work directly through posit.cloud.\n:::\n::::\n",
