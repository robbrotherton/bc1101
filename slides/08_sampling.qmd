# 8|SAMPLING {.lecture-title}

![](covers/08_sampling.gif)


# Overview

- Sampling error
- Central Limit Theorem

## Roadmap

- So far...  
  - $z$-scores describe the location of a single score in a sample or in a population
  - Normal distributions: precisely quantify probability of obtaining certain *scores*
- Moving forward...


# Sampling error

- Sampling Error
  - Discrepancy between a sample statistic and the population parameter

## Sampling error

- Sampling Error
  - Discrepancy between a sample statistic and the population parameter
  - E.g. Opinion polling

# Sampling distribution

- "Distribution of Sample Means" / "Sampling distribution of the mean"
  - Distribution of sample means obtained by selecting all possible samples of size $n$ from a population
  - Often huge number of possible samples
  - But distribution forms a simple & predictable pattern

## Sampling distribution

- Characteristics
  - Shape
      - The distribution will be approximately normal
      - Sample $M$s are representative of population $\mu$
      - Most means will be close to $\mu$; means far from $\mu$ are rare
  - Center
      - The center/average of the distribution will be close to $\mu$
      - $M$ is a *unbiased* statistic
      - *On average*, $M = \mu$
  - Variability
      - Related to sample size, $n$
      - The larger the sample, the less the variability 
      - Larger samples are more representative



# Central Limit Theorem

- Sampling & the Central Limit Theorem
  - Distribution of samples means based on all possible samples from a population not feasible in most realistic situations
- Central Limit Theorem
  - We can mathematically predict shape, mean, & variability for any sample size & population
  - For any population with mean $\mu$ and standard deviation $\sigma$, the distribution of sample means for sample size n will have…
  - An expected mean $\mu_M$ of $\mu$ 
  - A standard deviation of $\dfrac{\sigma} {\sqrt{n}}$ 
  - And will approach a normal distribution as $n$ approaches infinity


## Shape

- Shape of the sampling distribution
  - Almost perfectly normal in either of two conditions 
  - The population from which the samples are selected is a normal distribution
  - Or…
  - Sample $n$s are relatively large<br><br>

::: {.fragment}
- ...what is *relatively large*? 
  - As $n$ approaches infinity, distribution of sample means approaches a normal distribution 
  - But by $n = 30$ means pile up symmetrically around $\mu$
  - Population distribution does not need to be normal; can be skewed, flat, bimodal, whatever
:::

## Mean

- Mean of the sampling distribution
  - Mean of the distribution of sample means is called the expected value of $M$ ( $\mu_M$ ) 
  - On average, $M = \mu_M  = \mu$
  - $M$ is unbiased
  - If we only have a single sample $M$, our best guess at the (unknown) population mean should always be the (known) sample mean
  - But we can acknowledge variability...

## Variability

- Variability of the sampling distribution
  - Standard deviation of the sample means
  - "Standard error of the mean";  $\sigma_M$
  - Measure of how well a sample mean estimates its population mean
  - How much sampling error we can expect; how much distance is expected on average between $M$ and $\mu$

$\sigma_M = \dfrac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}$ or $\dfrac{\sqrt{\sigma^2}}{\sqrt{n}}$ or $\sqrt{\dfrac{\sigma^2}{n}}$

## Summary

- Summary
  - Distribution of sample means for samples of size $n$ will have...
    - a mean of $\mu_M$
    - standard deviation $\sigma_M = \sigma / \sqrt{n}$
    - Shape will be normal if population is normally distributed, or $n > 30$

# Learning checks

1. True or False?
  - The mean of a sample is always equal to the population mean
  - The shape of a distribution of sample means is always normal
  - As sample size increases, the value of the standard error always decreases
2. Describe the distribution of sample means (shape, expected value of the mean, and standard error) for samples of $n = 100$ selected from a population with $\mu = 40$ and $\sigma = 10$.
