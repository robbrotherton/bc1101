# 7|PROBABILITY

![](covers/07_probability.svg)


# Overview

- What do statisticians mean by "probability"?
  - Quantifying probability
- "Random sampling"
- Probability and $z$-scores
- Making inferences


# Probability and games

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column .small}
- Probability & games
    - Settlers of Catan
    - Board of hex tiles, each with a number
    - Place “settlements” at intersection of tiles
    - Each turn, roll 2 dice
    - You get resources if your settlement is touching the rolled total
    - __Where do you put your first settlement?__

## Definition and notation

- Definition & notation
    - Several different outcomes are possible
    - The probability of any specific outcome is a fraction of all possible outcomes
    - $p$ is the symbol for “probability”
    - Probability of some specific outcome is specified by $p(event)$
    
$p(A) = \dfrac{number \ of \ outcomes \ classified \ as \ A}{total \ number \ of \ possible \ outcomes}$

## Example: coin flip

- E.g. Flipping a coin
    - Numerator: number of those outcomes
    - Denominator: all possible outcomes

![](media/heads.png)
$p(heads) = 1/2 = .5$ 

![](media/tails.png)

$p(tails) = 1/2 = .5%$


## Example: rolling dice

- All possible outcomes:
- 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6

$p(6) = 1/6 = 0.17$

$p(1) = \ ?$

$p(odd) = \ ?$  



## Example: rolling 2 dice

```{r}

library(kableExtra)

d <- as.data.frame(outer(1:6 ,1:6,FUN="+"))
d$blue <- 1:6
d <- d[c(7,1:6)]

colnames(d) <- c("",1:6)

dice_tab <- knitr::kable(d, 'html', escape = F, align ='c') %>%
  row_spec(1:6, background = "white") %>%
  column_spec(1:7, width = "20px") %>%
  row_spec(0, color = 'red') %>%
  column_spec(1, color = "blue", border_right = "1px solid black", bold = T)
  # column_spec(c(3,4), width = "20%")

dice_tab
```


## Example: marbles

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column}
![](media/jar-5050.png)
:::

::: {.column}
- Jar of marbles
    - Jar is population
    - Contains 25 white & 25 blue marbles
    - What is the probability of randomly drawing a white marble?
    - Number of those outcomes (25)
    - Divided by total number of outcomes (50)

$p(white) = 25/50 = .5$

## Example: marbles

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column}
![](media/jar-8020.png)
:::

::: {.column}
- Different jar
    - 40 blue & 10 white marbles
    - What is the probability of randomly drawing a white marble?
    
$p(white) = 10/50 = .2$
:::

## Repeated sampling

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column}
![](media/jar-8020.png)
:::

::: {.column}
- Repeated sampling
    - 40 blue, 10 white
    - What is the probability of randomly drawing one white marble and then drawing a second white marble?

$p(first \ white) = 10/50 = .2$

$p(second \ white)$ depends on whether we put the first one back or not

::: {.column}
- Without replacement

$$\begin{align} p(white) & = 10/50 = .2 \\
p(second \ white) & = 9/49 \approx .18 \\
p(both \ white) & = .2 * .18  \approx .037 \end{align}$$

- With replacement

$\begin{align} p(white) &= 10/50 = .2 \\
p(second \ white) &= 10/50 = .2 \\
p(both \ white) &= .2 * .2 = .04\end{align}$

## Random sampling

- “Random sample” definition
    - A sample produced by a process that assures:
        1. Each individual in the population has an equal chance of being selected
        2. Probability of being selected stays constant from one selection to the next when more than one individual is selected
    - “Independent random sampling”
- Requires sampling __with replacement__


# Probability and distributions

```{r out.width='100%'}
library(ggplot2)
set.seed(42)
x <- sample(1:6, 10, replace = T)

df <- data.frame(score = x, obs = 1:length(x))

p <- ggplot(df, aes(x = score, group = obs)) +
  scale_y_continuous(expand = c(0,0)) +
  coord_fixed() +
  labs(x = "Score", y = "Frequency") +
  papaja::theme_apa()

prob_plot <- p + geom_histogram(binwidth = 1, color = "black", fill = "darkgrey")

prob_plot

```


# Probability and z-scores

- Normal distribution
    - Symmetrical
    - Highest frequency in the middle
    - Tapers off towards the extremes
    - Very common distribution shape
    - Defined by an equation
    - Can be described by the proportions of area contained in each section


# Learning checks

Which (if any) of the following meet the definition of a true random sample?

1. Several contestants spinning the wheel on The Price is Right to pick a number
2. Standing on the street and surveying people who happen to walk by
3. Getting Intro Psych students to participate in return for course credit
4. Calling random phone numbers from a database
