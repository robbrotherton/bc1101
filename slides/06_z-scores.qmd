## $z$-scores

- $z$-score formula:

$z = \dfrac{X - \mu}\sigma$
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;or...&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
$z = \dfrac{X - M}s$

- Numerator: deviation score
- Denominator: standard deviation
- $z$ expresses deviation in SD units

## $z$-scores

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column .small}
- $z$-score describes exact location of any score in a distribution
- Two pieces of information:
  - Sign
    - Positive or negative
    - Indicates whether score is located above or below the mean
  - Magnitude
    - Indicates distance between score and mean in standard deviation units
    - $z = 0$ is equal to the mean

# $z$-score to raw score

- Determining raw score from $z$-score

$z = \dfrac{X - \mu}\sigma$
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;so...&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
$X = \mu + z\sigma$

  - Algebraically solve for $X$ 
  - Raw score $X$ equals population mean plus $z$ multiplied by standard deviation 



# Standardized distributions

## Standardized distributions

- Every $X$ value can be transformed to a $z$-score
    - $z$-score distribution is called a standardized distribution 
- Characteristics of $z$-score transformation
    - Same shape as original distribution
    - Mean of $z$-score distribution is always $0$
        - Because the mean is the balance point; $\Sigma (X - \mu)$ always equals $0$
    - Standard deviation is always $1.00$
        - Because $SD$ is the denominator

## Other standardized distribtions

Other standardized distributions

- Standardized: Predetermined mean & SD
    - $z$ distribution has $\mu = 0$ and $\sigma = 1$
    - SAT has $\mu = 500$ and $\sigma = 100$
    - IQ has $\mu=100$ and $\sigma=15$ points<br><br>

- Standardizing a distribution has two steps
  1. Original raw scores transformed to $z$-scores
  2. The $z$-scores are transformed to new $X$ values so that the specific predetermined $\mu$ and $\sigma$ are attained  
      2a. Multiply to set SD  
      2b. Add or subtract a constant to set the mean

# $z$-scores and inferential stats

- What’s the use of $z$-scores?
  - Research questions are often about looking for differences
  - Does one individual seem different from others?
  - Is a sample “noticeably different” from the population?
  - $z$ is one indication of how typical a score is
  - $z \approx 0$ is a typical score; $z \le -2.00$ or $\ge 2.00$ are less typical




# Learning checks

::: {style="text-align: center;"}
$z = \dfrac{X - \mu}{\sigma}$

$X = \mu + z* \sigma$
:::

1. For a population with $\mu = 50$ and $\sigma = 10$, what is the $X$ value corresponding to $z = 0.4$?

2. In a sample distribution, $X = 56$ corresponds to $z = 1.00$, and $X = 47$ corresponds to $z = -0.50$. Find the mean and standard deviation for the sample.
