# Central tendency

- A single number to describe the center of a distribution

- Purpose: 
    - To organize & summarize scores
    - Find the single score that is most typical or best represents the entire group
    - Allow comparisons


## Finding the center

```{r distributions}
library(ggplot2)

distPlot <- function(x, y = NULL) {
  ggplot(NULL, aes(x = x)) + 
    geom_histogram(binwidth = 1, color = 'black', fill = 'grey') +
    scale_x_continuous(limits = c(.5,9.5), breaks = 1:9) +
    scale_y_continuous(expand = c(0,0)) +
    labs(x = "X", y = "Frequency") +
    papaja::theme_apa()
}  

sym <- c(2,3,3,4,4,4,5,5,5,5,6,6,6,7,7,8)
skew <- c(1,2,3,4,5,6,6,7,7,7,8,8,8,8,9,9)
bi <- c(1,1,2,2,2,2,3,3,7,7,8,8,8,8,9,9)

symPlot <- distPlot(sym)
skewPlot <- distPlot(skew)
biPlot <- distPlot(bi)
```

Where is the center of the distribution?

```{r out.width="90%", fig.asp=.5}

## Measures of central tendency

- Imagine you get the following grades:
  - 90, 0, 80, 85, 90
- How do you fairly describe all these scores with a single number?

- Three ways:
  - Mode = grade you get most often
  - Median = grade that divides lowest 50% of scores from highest 50% of scores
  - Mean = sum of grades / # of grades = $\dfrac{\Sigma X} N$
    
    
## Measures of central tendency

- Imagine you get the following grades:
  - 90, 0, 80, 85, 90
- Three ways:
  - Mode = <ins>90</ins>, 0, 80, 85, <ins>90</ins><br><br>
  - Median = 0, 80, <ins>85</ins>, 90, 90<br><br>
  - Mean = (<ins>90</ins> + <ins>0</ins> + <ins>80</ins> + <ins>85</ins> + <ins>90</ins>) / <ins>5</ins> = 69

# Median

## Median

- Definition:
  - The midpoint of the scores in a distribution when they are listed in order from smallest to largest
  - Divides the scores into two groups of equal size
  - Equal number of data points either side of the median
  - 50% below, 50% above


## Locating the median

- Put scores in order
- Find the number that gives and equal number of scores on either side

- Odd number of scores
  - Median is the center score

- Even number of scores:
  - Average the 2 numbers either side of center

::: {.center}

1 2	3	4	5	6

(3 + 4) / 2 = 3.5

65	70	70	80	90	90

65	70	80	80	80	90	92	95

# Mean

## Mean {.smaller}

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="70%"}
- What is the "average"?
    - Take a set of scores
    - Add them up
    - Divide by how many there are
- Developed in the 16th century
    - Mainly used by astronomers
- Adolphe Quetelet (1796-1874)
    - Applied the concept to people
    - Size measurements (BMI), divorce, crime, suicide
    - See [*The Atlantic*: How the Idea of a ‘Normal’ Person Got Invented](https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2016/02/the-invention-of-the-normal-person/463365/)

## History {.smaller}

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="60%"}
- American Civil War
    - Mass production of uniforms
    - Small, Medium, Large
    - Also food rations, weapon design, etc
- 1926: Plane cockpits
    - Based on average measurements
    - By WW2 worked terribly
    - Didn’t fit most pilots
    - Nobody is average on all dimensions

## Calculating the mean

- Calculating the mean
  - Sum of scores divided by number of scores
  - Represented by a symbol (unlike mode & median)

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}
Sample:
$M = \dfrac{\Sigma X} n$

(sometimes  
$X$ or $\overline{X}$)
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
Population:
$\mu = \dfrac{\Sigma X} N$
:::

## Visualizing the mean

- Another way of thinking about the mean
  - The balance point for the distribution

```{r balance, out.width='90%', fig.asp=.5}
# source("fun/plot_balance_beam.R")
# balance_beam
```


# Distributions

## Distributions

- Sensitivity to outliers
  - Extreme values; observations far from the center
  - Mean is more influenced by outliers than median

# Summary {.smaller}

- Mode
  - Most useful for nominal/ordinal data
  - Reflects the single most common score
  - Or more complicated (bimodal) distributions
- Median
  - Most useful for interval/ratio data
  - Represents the midpoint in terms of number of scores
  - Less influenced by outliers; helpful for skewed data
- Mean
  - Most useful for interval/ratio data
  - Represents the midpoint in terms of distances of scores
  - More influenced by outliers; best for normal data


# Learning checks

1. __True or False__: It is possible for more than 50% of the scores in a distribution to have values above the:
    a) mode
    b) mean
    c) median
2. What shape is this distribution?
```{r out.width='100%', fig.asp=.5}
ggplot(NULL) + 
  stat_function(fun = dbeta, args = list(5, 2)) +
  labs(x = "Negative skew") +
  theme_void()
```
  - What can you predict about its mode, mean, and median?
