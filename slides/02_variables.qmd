# 2|VARIABLES

![](covers/02_variables.png)



## Overview

- Statistics: Why? How? What?
- Terminology
    - Scales of measurement
    - Populations vs samples
    - Parameters vs statistics
    - Inferential vs descriptive statistics



## Making statistics


- Where do statistics come from?


## Producing a statistic

![](media/book.jpg)


## How many books are red?

- Gather data to determine what proportion of books are red
- Enter your best estimate and explain your process
- Suggested time limit: 5 minutes

## Making statistics

> "In the United States today half of all children (35.6 million) live in a household where a parent or other adult uses tobacco, drinks heavily or uses illicit drugs"^[[The National Center on  Addiction and Substance Abuse at Columbia University, 2005](https://web.archive.org/web/20191017204229/https://www.centeronaddiction.org/addiction-research/reports/family-matters-substance-abuse-and-american-family)
]]

- Other questions...
  - How many students are smokers?
  - Young people, narcissism, anxiety, depression ^[See [Singal, 2016](https://www.thecut.com/2016/03/for-80-years-young-americans-have-been-getting-more-anxious-and-depressed.html)]



## Constructs & operational definitions

- Construct: Extroversion
- Operational definition: Big 5 questions

::: {.fragment}
- Construct: Intelligence
- Operational definition: IQ test

:::{.fragment}
- Construct: Height
- Operational definition: How far the top of your head is from the floor according to a tape measure
:::

## Measuring things

- Operationalizing variables
  - Usually more than one way we could go about measuring & recording data
  - Result in different types of data, and potentially different applicable analyses
  - How to decide on operational definition?
- Aspects to consider:
  - Type of variable (discrete / continuous)
  - Scale of measurement (nominal / ordinal / interval / ratio)


## Types of variable {.smaller}

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}
- Discrete
  - Something we count as whole numbers
  - Made up of separate, indivisible categories
  - No values exist between neighboring categories
- Examples:
  - Number of children/cats/TVs
  - Positive cases
  - Hospital admissions
:::

::: {.column width="50%"} 
- Continuous
  - Something we can measure with decimals
  - Has infinite number of possible values
  - Every interval is divisible into infinite number of parts
- Examples
  - Height
  - Time
  - Temperature

## Scales of measurement {.smaller}

```{r echo=FALSE}
tab <- data.frame(Scale = c("Nominal","Ordinal","Interval","Ratio"),
                  
                  Characteristics = c("Named categories<br>
                                      No quantitative distinctions",
                                      "Ordered categories<br>
                                      Indicates direction, but not size of difference",
                                      "Ordered categories<br>
                                      Equal intervals between categories<br>
                                      Arbitrary or absent zero point",
                                      "Ordered categories<br>
                                      Equal interval between categories<br>
                                      Absolute zero point"),
                  
                  Examples = c("Gender<br>Eye color<br>Experimental condition",
                               "Rank<br>Clothing sizes<br>Olympic medals",
                               "Temperature (Celcius/Fahrenheit)<br>Golf scores",
                               "Temperature (Kelvin)<br>
                               Number of correct answers<br>
                               Response time")

## Measuring things

Likert scales

- E.g. "What is your current level of happiness?"

::: {.center}
1. A lot less than usual
2. A little less than usual
3. About average
4. A little more than usual
5. A lot more than usual
:::

## Populations & samples

## Populations & samples

![](media/pop-sample-ani.gif)

## Populations & samples

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}
- __Populations__
  - Population *parameters*
  - Usually Greek symbols
  - e.g. $\mu$; $N$
  - Inferential statistics
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
- __Samples__
  - Sample *statistics*
  - Usually letters
  - e.g. $M$; $n$
  - Descriptive statistics

## Learning checks

- A tax form asks people to identify their
  - Age
  - Annual income
  - Number of dependents
  - Social security number
- For each variable...
  1. Identify the scale of measurement that probably is used
  2. Explain whether the variable is continuous or discrete
