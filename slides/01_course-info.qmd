# Textbook


:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}
- Learning Statistics with R
  - By Danielle Navarro
  - Download as a .pdf for free
  - [learningstatisticswithr.com](https://learningstatisticswithr.com)
  - Helpful for seeing how things are done in R
  - As well as explaining statistical concepts

# Lectures

## Panopto

  - In-lecture quizzes
  - Navigation
  - Subtitles
  - Discussion
  - Also: Discussion forums on Canvas

## Topics

- Basic issues:
  - Terminology, variables & measurement
- Descriptive statistics: 
  - Frequency, central tendency, variability, z-scores
- Inferential statistics:
  - Probability, sampling; hypothesis testing
  - $t$-tests; ANOVA; Correlation & regression
- Logical progression


# Recitation

## R problem sets

- Practical application of stats to data
  - Using RStudio Cloud
  - Show code; how you worked out answers
  - Work on .qmd in RStudio Cloud
  - Upload rendered .pdf to Canvas

## Grading

- Wrong answers ≠ lower grade
  - 0, 1, or 2 points
  - 0 = No submission, 1 = Incomplete, 2 = Valid attempt
  - Deadline: 5pm day of recitation

```{r echo=T}
# comment your R code to show thought process

# e.g. here I'm adding 2 and 2
2 + 2 
```

# Exams

- 3 multiple choice exams
  - Multiple choice
  - 60 minutes
  - Only lecture material, not R
  - Non-cumulative
  - Except inasmuch as later concepts rely on ones introduced earlier
- Some questions will involve sums, but only simple ones you can do on paper

# Final grades

- Final grade
  - 20% Lecture / discussion forum engagement
  - 20% Problem Sets
  - 60% 3 multiple choice exams (20% each)


# Other stuff

## Math

- Statistics requires basic math skills

- E.g. order of operations
  1. Parentheses
  2. Exponents (like squaring/square root)
  3. Multiplication & division
  4. Summation
  5. Addition & subtraction

## Math

- Summation
  - Symbol $\Sigma$ (Greek letter Sigma) means add up
  - Summation is done after operations in parentheses, squaring, and multiplication or division, but before other addition or subtraction
  - E.g… $X = [2, 4, 7]$


$$\Sigma X = ? \\
\Sigma X + 1 = ? \\
\Sigma(X + 1) = ?$$

## Math

- Algebra
  - Rearranging equations
  - E.g.


$$\begin{align}12 &= 7 + X \\ X &= ? \end{align}$$
