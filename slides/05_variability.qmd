# Variability

Imagine you and a friend got the following scores

```{r}
you <- c(0,4,5,5,6,10)
friend <- c(0,1,5,5,9,10)
```

- You: `r you`
- Friend: `r friend`

How would you describe the difference in your performances?

::: {.fragment}
- Same mode/mean/median
- But one seems more *variable* than the other
:::


## Variability

- Like the mean
    - A descriptive statistic
    - Single number to summarize dataset
- Unlike the mean
    - Rather than describing the middle of the data, variability describes the spread of the data
    - Higher variability means greater differences between scores
- Purpose of measures of variability
    - Quantify how well an individual score represents the distribution
    - Important for inferential stats


## Variability

- Measures of variability
    - Quantitative distance measures based on the differences between scores
    - Each has different characteristics
- Range
    - Describes the spread of scores
    - Distance of most extreme scores from each other
- $SS$, Variance, and Standard Deviation
    - Companion concepts, but different things
    - Describe distance of scores from the mean
    - Small values: low variability; scores clustered close to mean
    - Higher values: greater variability; scores widely scattered



# Range

## Range

- Difference between lowest & highest scores
    - Distance covered by the scores in a distribution 
    - Range = $X_{max} - X_{min}$

```{r}
print_range <- function(x) {
  paste(max(x), " - ", min(x), " = ", max(x) - min(x))
}
```

- You: `r you`
- Range = `r print_range(you)`

- Friend: `r friend`
- Range = `r print_range(friend)`

## Range

- Characteristics
    - Does not consider all the data
    - Based only on two scores: most extreme values
    - Imprecise, unreliable measure of variability
    - Not often useful for descriptive/inferential stats
- But checking range & min/max values can be useful for finding mistakes in data input
    - Impossible range / min & max values


# Sum of squares, variance, SD

- Definitions:
    - Deviation
        - Distance from the mean: deviation score = $X – \mu$
    - $SS$: Sum of squares
        - Sum of squared deviations
    - Variance
        - The mean squared deviation
        - Average squared distance from the mean
    - Standard deviation
        - The square root of the variance
        - Provides a measure of the average (standard) distance of scores from the mean

Calculations differ for population and samples

## Variance

- Determine the deviation of each score
    - Distance from the mean
    - Deviation score = $X - \mu$

```{r balance, out.width='70%', fig.asp=.3}
bc1101tools::balance_beam(c(1, 2, 6, 6, 10))
```

- To find “average deviation” just sum the deviations and then divide by $n$?

::: {.fragment}
- Nope! Dead end
- Always sums to $0$

## Variance

:::: {.columns .fragment}
::: {.column width="60%"}
1. Find the deviation for each score
:::
::: {.column width="40%"}
$X - \mu$
:::
:::: 

:::: {.columns .fragment}
::: {.column width="60%"}
2. Square deviations
:::
::: {.column width="40%"}
$(X - \mu)^2$
:::
::::

:::: {.columns .fragment}
::: {.column width="60%"}
3. Sum the squared deviations
:::
::: {.column width="40%"}
$SS = \Sigma(X - \mu)^2$
:::
::::

:::: {.columns .fragment}
::: {.column width="60%"}
4. Find average of squared deviations
:::
::: {.column width="40%"}
$\sigma^2 = \dfrac{SS}N$
:::
::::

:::: {.columns .fragment}
::: {.column width="60%"}
5. Take square root of variance
:::
::: {.column width="40%"}
$\sigma = \sqrt{\sigma^2} = \sqrt{\dfrac{SS}N}$
