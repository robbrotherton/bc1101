# Variability

Imagine you and a friend got the following scores

```{r}
you <- c(0,4,5,5,6,10)
friend <- c(0,1,5,5,9,10)
```

-   You: `r you`
-   Friend: `r friend`

How would you describe the difference in your performances?

::: fragment
-   Same mode/mean/median
-   But one seems more *variable* than the other
:::

## Variability {.small}

-   Like the mean
    -   A [descriptive]{.emph} statistic
    -   Single number to summarize dataset
-   Unlike the mean
    -   Rather than describing the [middle]{.emph} of the data, variability describes the [spread]{.emph} of the data
    -   Higher variability means greater differences between scores
-   Purpose
    -   Quantify how well an individual score represents the distribution
    -   Important for inferential stats

## Measures of variability {.small}

-   Quantitative distance measures based on the differences between scores
    -   Each has different characteristics
-   Range
    -   Describes the spread of scores
    -   Distance of most extreme scores from each other
-   $SS$, Variance, and Standard Deviation
    -   Companion concepts, but different things
    -   Describe distance of scores from the mean
    -   Small values: low variability; scores clustered close to mean
    -   Higher values: greater variability; scores widely scattered

# Range

## Range

-   Difference between lowest & highest scores
    -   Distance covered by the scores in a distribution
    -   Range = $X_{max} - X_{min}$

```{r}
print_range <- function(x) {
  paste(max(x), " - ", min(x), " = ", max(x) - min(x))
}
```

- You: `r you`
    - $`r max(you)` - `r min(you)` = `r max(you) - min(you)`$

- Friend: `r friend`
    - $`r max(friend)` - `r min(friend)` = `r max(friend) - min(friend)`$

## Range

-   Characteristics
    -   Does not consider all the data
    -   Based only on two scores: most extreme values
    -   Imprecise, unreliable measure of variability
    -   Not often useful for descriptive/inferential stats
-   But checking range & min/max values can be useful for finding mistakes in data input
    -   Impossible range / min & max values

# Sum of squares, variance, SD

## Definitions {.smaller}

-   Deviation
    -   Distance from the mean: deviation score = $X – \mu$
-   $SS$: Sum of squares
    -   Sum of squared deviations
-   Variance
    -   The mean squared deviation
    -   Average squared distance from the mean
    - [Calculation differs for population and samples]{.emph}
-   Standard deviation
    -   The square root of the variance
    -   Provides a measure of the average (standard) distance of scores from the mean




## Variance {.small}

-   Determine the deviation of each score
    -   Distance from the mean
    -   Deviation score = $X - \mu$

![](media/central-tendency-balance-2.svg){style="height: 7em; margin-top: -0.5em; margin-bottom: -0.5em;"}

- To find "average deviation" just sum the deviations and divide by $n$?
    - Dead end; always sums to $0$

## Variance

::: {.columns .fragment}
::: {.column width="60%"}
1.  Find the deviation for each score
:::

::: {.column width="40%"}
$X - \mu$
:::
:::

::: {.columns .fragment}
::: {.column width="60%"}
2.  Square deviations
:::

::: {.column width="40%"}
$(X - \mu)^2$
:::
:::

::: {.columns .fragment}
::: {.column width="60%"}
3.  Sum the squared deviations
:::

::: {.column width="40%"}
$SS = \Sigma(X - \mu)^2$
:::
:::

::: {.columns .fragment}
::: {.column width="60%"}
4.  Find average of squared deviations
:::

::: {.column width="40%"}
$\sigma^2 = \dfrac{SS}N$
:::
:::

::: {.columns .fragment}
::: {.column width="60%"}
5.  Take square root of variance
:::

::: {.column width="40%"}
$\sigma = \sqrt{\sigma^2} = \sqrt{\dfrac{SS}N}$
:::

## Standard deviation

# Degrees of freedom {.smaller}

-   Why $n – 1$?\
-   Degrees of freedom
    -   Number of scores in sample that are independent and free to vary
-   Population variance
    -   Mean is known: Deviations are computed from a known mean (not one we had to calculate)
-   Sample variance as estimate of population
    -   Population mean is unknown: We calculate sample mean instead, as an estimate of population parameter
    -   Then use calculated mean to calculate deviations
    -   $df$ is $n$ minus number of population parameter estimates we already calculated

## Degrees of freedom {.smaller}

- Why $n – 1$?
    - $M = 5$
    - $n = 3$
- If you know the first 2 scores:
    - 3, 5
    - $M = \dfrac{\Sigma X}{N} = \dfrac{3 + 5 + X}{3}$
    - So $X = 3*M - 3 - 5 = 7$
- There is only 1 possible value that $X$ can be
    - It is not free to vary
    - We've lost 1 degree of freedom

# Learning checks

1. Is it possible for a sample to have a standard deviation of zero?

2. A sample of four scores has $SS = 24$. What is the variance?

3. Why do samples systematically have less variability than the population?
