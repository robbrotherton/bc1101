\hypertarget{course-overview}{%
\subsection{Course Overview}\label{course-overview}}

This course, required for the psychology major, provides an introduction
to statistical methods commonly used in psychological research. Topics
include measures of central tendency and variability, probability and
sampling, confidence intervals and hypothesis testing, t-test and
analysis of variance, correlation and regression. In addition to
learning the conceptual and mathematical underpinnings of these
techniques, you will learn to calculate and interpret statistics with
reference to real-world contexts and research questions typical in
psychological research. The course includes recitation meetings that
provide instruction in the analysis of psychological data using the R
statistical software package commonly used by behavioral science
researchers.

The course is designed to fulfill these goals:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Understand what statistics are, and why and when they are needed
\item
  Translate observations about the world into statistical statements and
  questions
\item
  Learn how statistical methods are used to test psychological
  hypotheses
\item
  Use statistical software (R) to describe, visualize, analyze, and
  report data
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{course-format}{%
\subsection{Course format}\label{course-format}}

There are no required readings. Instead, you will be required to watch
recorded lectures before attending the associated class session.

\hypertarget{video-lectures}{%
\subsubsection{Video lectures}\label{video-lectures}}

The lecture component of the course will take the form of streamable
Panopto lectures, accessible via Canvas. You must watch the video
lecture before attending the associated class session. These video
lectures will be around 15 to 25 minutes each. They will include
`quizzes' that appear during the video, requiring your response before
you continue with the lecture. So even though the videos themselves are
short, you should plan to spend an hour or more with each one including
the time it takes you to answer the questions and complete the exercises
included along the way. Panopto keeps a record of your responses, and
your engagement will be required and graded (see
\protect\hyperlink{grading}{Grading}).

\hypertarget{class-time}{%
\subsubsection{Class time}\label{class-time}}

Since you will have watched the recorded lecture in advance of class,
class time will be devoted to activities, discussions, and your
questions to help cement the understanding you will have begun to
develop from the watching the lecture. Class activities are designed to
build on the lecture you watched in advance; you will not be able to get
the most out of the class without watching the associated lecture first.
Given the nature of the activities and discussions I have planned,
in-person classes will not be streamed or recorded.

\hypertarget{recitation}{%
\subsubsection{Recitation}\label{recitation}}

While the lecture component of the course covers the material
conceptually, recitations will focus on practical application:
performing statistical analyses using computer software, specifically R.
Problem sets will be accessed via RStudio Cloud, a free,
web-browser-based version of the RStudio software interface that
facilitates coding and running analyses using the R coding language.
Instructions and advice will be self-contained in the problem sets as
comments and pre-written demonstration code, and additional help and
guidance will be available during recitation sessions. You will complete
the problem sets by writing and executing code to answer the problems.
Problem sets will be due at the end of your recitation period. You
should plan to begin the problem set in advance of recitation and come
to recitation to receive assistance with any problems you run into or
just to check you were doing things correctly and as effectively as
possible.

\hypertarget{exams}{%
\subsubsection{Exams}\label{exams}}

There will be three multiple choice exams throughout the course (see
\protect\hyperlink{class-schedule}{class schedule}). The exams will
cover material from the lectures (not R). Each exam will cover
approximately one-third of the course material. The lecture before each
exam will be set aside for a review discussion. Also, on weeks with
exams, there will be no recitation problem set due.

\hypertarget{expected-workload}{%
\subsubsection{Expected workload}\label{expected-workload}}

The college usually expects each course credit to correspond to 3 hours
of work in and/or outside of the classroom. Since this is a 4 credit
course, that means 12 hours per week. There will be 2 lectures per week
and 1 recitation, totaling 2.5 hours. Therefore, you should plan to
spend up to a further 9.5 hours outside of class working on class
material (watching the video lectures; working on problem sets;
revising; etc).

\hypertarget{grading}{%
\subsection{Grading}\label{grading}}

Your final grade will be based on your scores for each of the following
components, weighted as follows:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Exams: 50\%
\item
  Problem Sets: 30\%
\item
  Participation: 20\%
\end{itemize}

Numeric scores will be rounded up or down to the nearest whole number
and letter grades will be determined according to the following
boundaries:

\begin{verbatim}
Letter grade:  A+ A  A- B+ B  B- C+ C  C- D  F
Numeric score: 97 93 90 87 83 80 77 73 70 60 <60
\end{verbatim}

\hypertarget{participation}{%
\subsubsection{Participation}\label{participation}}

Participation across the semester will contribute 20\% of your final
grade. Participation includes your engagement with the Panopto lectures
and their in-lecture questions, as well as coming to class and
recitation prepared to discuss and ask questions about the lecture and
recitation material. You will be able to earn a passing grade by
watching the lectures and completing the in-lecture quizzes, though
earning an outstanding grade (i.e, A+) will require regular
participation in discussions.

\hypertarget{problem-sets}{%
\subsubsection{Problem Sets}\label{problem-sets}}

In total, the Recitation Problem Sets will contribute 30\% of your final
grade. Problem Sets will be due at the end of your recitation session.
For each Problem Set, you will receive a grade of 0, 1, or 2, where 0
means you didn't submit it; 1 means a submission with substantial
omissions; and 2 means a valid, complete attempt. Note that in R, there
is often more than one way to arrive at a correct solution. This grading
scheme is intended to encourage you to explore different ways of doing
things and take your best shot at solving all the problems, even if you
are unsure whether you are doing things correctly. Full credit will be
given where effort has been made, even if the answers are incorrect. You
can show the effort you made, as well as highlighting aspects you don't
find clear, by commenting your code thoroughly.

\hypertarget{exams-1}{%
\subsubsection{Exams}\label{exams-1}}

The 3 multiple choice exams (see dates in class schedule) will
contribute a total of 50\% of your final grade.

\hypertarget{additional-resources}{%
\subsection{Additional Resources}\label{additional-resources}}

\hypertarget{empirical-reasoning-center}{%
\subsubsection{Empirical Reasoning
Center}\label{empirical-reasoning-center}}

If you feel like you need guidance with R outside of Recitation \&
office hours you can meet with fellows at Barnard's Empirical Reasoning
Center. Many of the fellows specialize in R and have walk-in hours.

\hypertarget{academic-accommodations-and-general-wellness}{%
\subsubsection{Academic Accommodations and general
wellness}\label{academic-accommodations-and-general-wellness}}

It is always important to recognize the different pressures, burdens,
and stressors you may be facing, whether personal, emotional, physical,
financial, mental, or academic. The current circumstances may well add
to these challenges for many people in many ways. The college recognizes
this, and is prepared to provide assistance to students in need. Many of
the available services and sources of help are being reshaped in
response to the changing circumstances. Rather than include boilerplate
text here or link to sources of information which may become outdated, I
encourage you to seek advice from your advisor, Dean, or the Center for
Accessibility Resources \& Disability Services (CARDS), and to let me
know of any issues you wish to share with me that you feel are impacting
your ability to complete the course to the best of your ability.
